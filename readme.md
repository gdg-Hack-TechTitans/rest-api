# GDG Hack - Event Management Platform
Welcome to the Event Management Platform developed for GDG Hack, an internal hackathon organized exclusively for GDG Algiers members. This platform aims to revolutionize event management, providing a comprehensive solution for competitive events, including hackathons and ideathons.

## Overview
In this 32-hour coding marathon, participants have the opportunity to address three significant challenges faced by GDG Algiers. Each challenge represents a unique difficulty that requires creative problem-solving and collaboration. The hackathon is not just a competition; it's a chance to bring the GDG Algiers family together, fostering unity, enthusiasm, and innovation.

## Technologies Used
- **FastAPI Backend** üöÄ: We chose FastAPI, a modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+. It provides automatic documentation, validation, and a high-performance asynchronous system.

- **PostgreSQL Database** üêò: Our backend utilizes PostgreSQL as the database to ensure robust and scalable data storage.

## Features
- Flexible Judging Criteria: The platform offers a highly flexible judging system, allowing customization of criteria for a personalized judging experience.

- Seamless Submission Process: Participants can easily submit their projects through the platform, streamlining the submission process.

- Interactive Dashboard: An interactive dashboard provides audiences with an overview of previous initiatives, fostering a sense of community and collaboration.
